# Chip Stealer 9000
A multiplayer team based first person shooter made for the granite game jam 2025. Unfathomably unpolished.

Set on the campus of the University of Aberdeen, play as a student trying to get to class without their lunch getting stolen by seagulls, or play as a seagull trying to steal a students lunch.

### Seagull
Seagulls can fly around the map and grab a students chips with ```spacebar``` when close enough.

### Student
Students must run to their next class, indicated with a tall blue waypoint. They can stun seagulls by shooting them.
